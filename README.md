# NASA Rover App

NASA Rover App allows users to view photos taken by NASA's Mars rovers throughout their operational periods. The data is fetched via the official NASA API.

## 🚀 Features

⚠️ Current Limitations:

Filtering by date and camera is not yet implemented.

Due to external API limitations, photos currently load only for the Curiosity rover, while Spirit and Opportunity do not return results.
